This at some point was a collection for Tools in an UWP App.

Since Micro$oft discontinued Windows Phone (still the best user experience I ever had in a mobile device) this is essentially useless.\
not that it ever was that useful (or even complete) ever anyway...\

This was more an aspiration of what I 'one day' wanted to have but it never reached much.\
I'm sure alsmost nothing would still work and knowing how long ago I made this I (and how much I didn't know back then) I would NOT trust any of this code to be safe or secure...\

If you find anything of use in here, have fun, but I doubt there's anything good in here
